# 100 Days of Code

## Log

### D1

Nothing special yet, just create the Github repo and try to start a new notebook with some Kaggle dataset i found.

### D2

Today I used AWS RDS in order to create a database, also I connected to it using pgAdmin4, it was hard but I got it, maybe tomorrow I will repeat this, even if there's nothing to code, I will write my progress here.

### D3

Just plotted some things that i thought it was cool

### D4

I was trying to do some Linear Regressions, not done yet xD

### D5

I tried to do a function that tells you if an instagram name is already in use, not working yet :(

### D6

I noticed that my function won't work because of instagram XD, so I started with other stuff, i connected to the DB using AWS Secrets Manager, this is funny.

### D7

Plotting boring stuff in the first notebook, i did not work too much today, maybe because it's sunday xd

### D8

I came back to school, so i did some linear regressions(again) at a very boring class xd

### D9

Today i reviewed something about an old project, updates coming soon

### D10

I create the ortools notebook, im planning to upload a code to EC2

### D11

I created a function that does a linear regression

### D12

Today i started creating a SPAM classifier, soon i will finish it

## D13

I continued with the naive bayes, which is going to help me for the spam classifier

## D14

Having a little progress with the classifier, i hope i finish it by tomorrow, or today :)

## D15

I kinda finished the classifier and also coded a function to calculate a linear multiple regression, without scikit learn obviously

## D16

Started to analyze this dataset: [](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+failure+clinical)+records# , soon i will publish my insights here

## D17

I did a PCA analysis to some dataset i found, also realized some plots for an scholar activity

## D18

I worked with Amazon Polly today, i also did some things for school

## D19

I am coding a bayesian network for medical diagnosis...

## D20

Beginning to understand PCA...

## D21

Today i began with a school project

## D22

Continued with the project, i did some updates to my classifier, (not here but done in other directory)

## D23

I almost forgot to publish my changes, today i improved the bayesian network

## D24

Bayesian network done, i just changed the dataset and im all set for a new challenge
