# 100 Days of Code

## Log

### D1

Nothing special yet, just create the Github repo and try to start a new noteboo with some Kaggle dataset i found.

### D2

Today I used AWS RDS in order to create a database, also I connected to it using pgAdmin4, it was hard but I got it, maybe tomorrow I will repeat this, even if there's nothing to code, I will write my progress here.
