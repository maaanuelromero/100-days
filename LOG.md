# 100 Days of Code

## Log

### D1

Nothing special yet, just create the Github repo and try to start a new notebook with some Kaggle dataset i found.

### D2

Today I used AWS RDS in order to create a database, also I connected to it using pgAdmin4, it was hard but I got it, maybe tomorrow I will repeat this, even if there's nothing to code, I will write my progress here.

### D3

Just plotted some things that i thought it was cool

### D4

I was trying to do some Linear Regressions, not done yet xD

### D5

I tried to do a function that tells you if an instagram name is already in use, not working yet :(

### D6

I noticed that my function won't work because of instagram XD, so I started with other stuff, i connected to the DB using AWS Secrets Manager, this is funny.

### D7

Plotting boring stuff in the first notebook, i did not work too much today, maybe because it's sunday xd

### D8

I came back to school, so i did some linear regressions(again) at a very boring class xd
